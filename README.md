# LIGHT-SENSING-LOCOMOTIVE-ROBOT
This project is based on a light sensing robot capable of motion in any one direction which will move depending on different illumination conditions. It has been set in a way in which it will start moving if light level falls under a certain threshold value and immediately stop moving if light level increases and crosses this value. And this threshold value can be adjusted before hand to suit different environments or day and night changes so that the robot can nearly emulate or copy our perception of light and darkness at any given time or environment.
